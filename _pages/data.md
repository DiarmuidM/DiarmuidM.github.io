## Datasets

## Projects
I maintain a number of public Github repositories containing syntax for downloading, cleaning and analysing large-scale data about nonprofits; and learning data wrangling skills through Stata. 
* Republic of Ireland Charity Data [[link]] (https://github.com/DiarmuidM/repire_charity_data)
