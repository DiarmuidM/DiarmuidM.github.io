I am a Research Fellow in Social Policy at [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/index.aspx). I graduated with a Ph.D from the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/social-sciences/) in bonnie Scotland (where I was an Economic and Social Research Council collaborative doctoral student). I receieved an MSc in Applied Social Research from Stirling and a BBs in Information Systems from Cork Institute of Technology.

My research centres on charitable organisations, studying their accountability behaviour and motivations, and regulatory environment. My research employs large-scale administrative datasets that are mostly held by charity regulators in numerous jurisdictions. See my [Research](https://diarmuidm.github.io/research/) page for more information.

I am a former [Social Impact Strategy Doctoral Fellow](http://socialimpactstrategy.org/research-ideas/doctoralfellowship/) at the School of Social Policy & Practice, University of Pennsylvania, and winner, with Dr Alasdair Rutherford, of the [Campbell Adamson Memorial](https://blogs.ncvo.org.uk/2017/11/09/promoting-charity-accountability-understanding-disclosure-of-serious-incidents/) Prize for best paper at the Voluntary Sector Studies Network 2017 conference.

I am interested in academic and practitioner collaborations, particularly on the topic of leveraging novel, open and large-scale datasets for studying charitable organisations.
