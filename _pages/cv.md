I am a social scientist with experience in academia, the public and voluntary sectors, and consultancy work. My research explores the determinants of nonprofit misconduct, accountability and vulnerability, using linked administrative data derived from charity regulators internationally. I am currently researching post-war organisational change in the UK voluntary sector. I have methodological interests in the use of administrative data for social science research, data science and policy evaluation methods. My recent role involved scoping, organising and delivering knowledge exchange and networking events for businesses and academics interested in learning and applying data science approaches.
